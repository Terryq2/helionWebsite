                <p style="color: var(--whiteish);">Helion is a FIRST Robotics team founded in 2018, and is entirely composed of high school and middle school students. We are located at Dulwich College Beijing, and our purpose is to successfully construct and program a competition robot that will compete in a FIRST Robotics regional. Our belief is that not only will we develop as individuals in the different fields of robotics, but we will also grow as a team. We are certain that Helion will provide an incredible experience for young students, and will teach them the perseverance and dedication needed to progress and suceed on the path of their choosing, taking the spirit of Helion Robotics with them as they go forward into their lives.</p>

                    <p id="answer">The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition in which students compete using robots they made and try to score the most amount of points in a given situation. In the last few years it has gained widespread recognition from schools and universities around the world, with 81 million USD in scholarships being offered by a wide selection of universities and firms. Last year, FRC counted as many as 3,647 attending teams with more than 91,000 students and 25,000 mentors competing against each other from 27 different countries.
