            <p style="color: var(--whiteish);">Helion is a FIRST Robotics team founded in 2018, and is entirely
                composed of high school and middle school students. We are located at Dulwich College Beijing, and our
                purpose is to successfully construct and program a competition robot that will compete in a FIRST
                Robotics regional. Our belief is that not only will we develop as individuals in the different fields
                of robotics, but we will also grow as a team. We are certain that Helion will provide an incredible
                experience for young students, and will teach them the perseverance and dedication needed to progress
                and suceed on the path of their choosing, taking the spirit of Helion Robotics with them as they go
                forward into their lives.</p>

                <h3 class="question">What is the FRC?</h3>
                <p class="answer">The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics
                    competition in which students compete using robots they made and try to score the most amount of
                    points in a given situation. In the last few years it has gained widespread recognition from
                    schools and universities around the world, with 81 million USD in scholarships being offered by a
                    wide selection of universities and firms. Last year, FRC counted as many as 3,647 attending teams
                    with more than 91,000 students and 25,000 mentors competing against each other from 27 different
                    countries. Find out more about this competition <a id="link" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">

                <p class="answer">Community days are events in Dulwich College in which the spirit of STEM is inspired in
                    younger students through robot showcases and similiar STEM demostrations. We hope to have these
                    events as frequently as possible to encourage young students to follow the path of STEM in high
                    school.</p>
